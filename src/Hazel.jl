# TODO
# - change on_update to update
# - maybe change on_event to process_event? or just process?
# - DummyApplication -> Application, remove abstract? or
#   make methods implementations of AbstractApplication
# - change events: no handled, but on_event should return true if the event
#   has been dealt with
# - Remove on_ from AbstractLayer functions
