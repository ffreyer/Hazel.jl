# Hazel.jl

This is a pure Julia implementation of the [Hazel Engine](https://github.com/TheCherno/Hazel). It is based largely on the educational [youtube series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlrATfBNZ98dC-V-N3m0Go4deliWHPFwT) of its [original creator](https://github.com/TheCherno).

The implementation may heavily vary from the original.
